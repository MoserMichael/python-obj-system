Python is good at creating the illusion of being a simple programming language. Sometimes this illusion fails, like when you have to deal with the import/module system  [my attempts to get it](https://github.com/MoserMichael/pythonimportplayground). Another area of complexity is the object system, last week I tried to understand [python enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), it turns that they are built on top of [meta classes](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/2c56c97f015a7ea81719615ddcf3c745fba5b4f3/Lib/enum.py#L511), So now I have come to realize, that I really don't know much about python and its object system. The purpose of this text is to figure out, how the python object system ticks.

Objects recap:
    The object instance holds the __dict__ attribute of the object instance, it's value is a dictionary that holds the object instance members.
    The class is an object that is shared between all object instances, and it holds the static data (class variables, class methods)

What happens upon: foo = Foo() ?

Take the type of Foo - the metaclass of Foo, the metaclass both knows how to create an instance of the class Foo, and the object instances.
A metaclass is derived from built-in class 'type', The 'type' constructor with three argument creates a new class object. [see reference](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type)

    class_obj = Foo

The metaclass is used as a 'callable' - it has a __call__ method, and can therefore be called as if it were a function (see more about callables in the course on [decorators](https://github.com/MoserMichael/python-obj-system/blob/master/decorator.md))

Now this __call__ method creates and initialises the object instance.
The implementation of __call__ now does two steps:
   - Class creation is done in the [__new__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__new__) method of the metaclass.  The __new__ method creates the Foo class, it is called exactly once, upon class declaration (you will see this shortly, in the section on custom meta classes)
   - It uses the Foo class and calls its to create and initialise the object (call the __new__ method of the Foo class, in order to create an instance of Foo, then calls the __init__ instance method of the Foo class, on order to initialise it). This all done by the __call__ method of the metaclass.
     instance_of_foo = meta_class_obj.__call__()

print_md("""Python has support for [enum classes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html). An enum class lists a set of integer class variables, these variables can then be accessed both by their name, and by their integer value.

An example usage: Note that the class doesn't have a constructor, everything is being taken care of by the baseclass [enum.Enum](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.Enum) which is making use of a meta-class in he definition of the Enum class [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html), this metaclass [EnumMeta source code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/f6648e229edf07a1e4897244d7d34989dd9ea647/Lib/enum.py#L161)  then creates a behind the scene dictionary, that maps the integer values to their constant names.

The advantage is, that you get an exception, when accessing an undefined constant, or name. There are also more things there, please refer to the linked [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html)

Python meta-classes and decorators are very similar in their capabilities.
Both are tools for [metaprogramming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming), tools for modifying the program text, and treating and modifying code, as if it were data.

I would argue, that decorators are most often the easiest way of achieving the same goal.
However some things, like hooking the classification of classes and objects (implementing class methods [__instancecheck__ and __subclasscheck__](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#customizing-instance-and-subclass-checks), can only be done with meta-classes.

I hope, that this course has given you a better understanding, of what is happening under the hood, which would be a good thing.
